Geochemical Database of City X by M. Banta and Y. Wang

This folder contains the R codes for a project that aims to determine whether land cover has an effect on the concentration of elements (mostly trace metals) obtained from Depths A and B of a certain city (City X) in Aotearoa New Zealand.
The dataset cannot be uploaded for privacy purposes (as I obtained it with permission from a Crown Research Institute in NZ), but I'm happy to share the code to create boxplots and correlation plots, and to perform statistical analysis such as PERMANOVA and Principal Component Analysis.
This folder also contains the output (e.g. boxplot, corrplot, PERMANOVA, PCA) using the commands in the R file.

Our objectives are:
#1. To create a boxplot of our element(s) of interest.
#2. To know if the land cover has an effect on metal concentrations, by performing PERMANOVA.
#3. To visualize the relationship among our variables for Depth A, by performing Principal Component Analysis.

Cheers,
M.B.
